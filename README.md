# Projects
Different Pyhton projects that I did at school

**PMI-Jupyter** : is a group project in Python I have done last year. The aim was to validate that the Beer-Lambert law could be applied to the crossing of a minefield.

**WSN_Mailys Le Strat** : is a 8h project in which I had to display the power consumed depending on the number of cycle choose by the user. It was asked to do only one source code for this. The difficulty was to learn how to use the Tkinter in few hours to use it to create the interface has we had never used it before. 

**Missile**: I made it during a lab session. The aim was to detect were the missile was on a picture and to detect its exact position. 

**DM3_LeStrat_Mailys** : The aim was to write different function to "play" with character string. The different function are for example: reverse, palindrome (which indicate if the word is a palindrome or not), anagram (which tells if two word are anagrams)... I made this code 3 years ago when I was debuting Python so there might be some inadvertences. 

I also coded various function to sort data and functions using recursivity.
